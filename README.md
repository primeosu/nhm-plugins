**Custom NiceHash Miner Plugins**

On February 17, 2022, NiceHash announced that they will no longer support unsigned and unverified miners (https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/nicehash-miner-ceases-support-for-unsigned-and-unverified-miners).  This is my attempt to create custom NHM plugins to replace popular miners like GMiner and T-Rex.

## Instructions
1. Follow the NHM instructions to create a new empty user plugin: https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner/tree/master/doc/UserPlugins
2. Copy contents over for the appropriate miner plugin
3. Update miner in `bin` directory if a newer version exists

## Completed
GMiner (https://github.com/develsoftware/GMinerRelease)

## TODO
T-Rex (https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex)
