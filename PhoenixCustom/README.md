# PhoenixMiner

## Instructions
1. Download the latest release here:
https://phoenixminer.info/downloads/
2. Extract the contents into the `bins` directory

## Notes
- Disabled SSL miner settings due to no Phoenix option to disable certificate validation. Need either this option added or the NiceHash pool to use a valid certificate.
